"#Places Been MERN-Project" 

A MERN application where you can keep track of the places to be visited and those you have already visited, or at least the places you like. Designed a REST API in the backend using Node and Express. Used React Hooks in the entire application with functional components. Used mongoose package to model JSON data. Apart from the technologies mentioned below, I have used OpenCage Geocoding API for getting latitude-longitude pair and OpenLayers API to render the dynamic maps in the front-end.

Technologies Used:

Front-end: React, HTML5, CSS3

Back-end: NodeJS, ExpressJS (REST API)

Database: MongoDB Atlas (mongoose)

Hosting: Heroku, Firebase
